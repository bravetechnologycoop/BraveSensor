# BraveSensor

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/bravetechnologycoop/BraveSensor.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/bravetechnologycoop/BraveSensor)

This is the BraveSensors monorepo. The Firmware and Server directories each have their own README.

NOTE: To interact with the firmware using the VSCode Particle Workbench, make sure to open the folder directly in VSCode (Open Folder -> BraveSensor/firmware/\<desired application\>)

If not, one may get an error (after being prompted to open the 'project properties' file) along the lines of "Could not find task: Compile application & DeviceOS (local) for ... ". 

So for example working on the boron-ins-fms project, one should open "C:\...\BraveSensor\firmware\boron-ins-fsm"
