[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bravetechnologycoop/BraveSensor-Server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bravetechnologycoop/BraveSensor-Server)

This is the BraveSensors monorepo. The Firmware and Server directories each have their own README.

NOTE: To interact with the firmware using the VSCode Particle Workbench, make sure to open the folder directly in VSCode (Open Folder -> BraveSensor/firmware/<desired application>)
